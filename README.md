# SQL-Employee-Tracker

A command-line application using SQL and Express to run a database
that the user can interact with when running with node. This app 
allows users to view, add, and edit employees, roles, departments, and managers.

Here is a video demonstrating the functionality: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5-dap5QUxu1mcnEtWREBmVwL-2zre1Z/view]

## Installation 

To use this appplication, first clone the repository to your local
machine. Then, navigate to the folder in your directory. It is 
required that you install MySQL, MYSQL2, Node, and Express. You
also need to navigate to the connection.js file within the app, 
and add your SQL password (if you have one, otherwise skip this step).

Once you have all the preresiquites done, type "npm i" or "npm install"
into the command line and let that run. After that, connect to MySQL
and start the app by typing "node server.js" . From there you simply 
follow the prompts and navigate using arrow keys and enter .

### Motivation 

Pulled from our README with instructions: 
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers
to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These 
interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The assignment
was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's 
employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

### Technologies Used

As mentioned, you will need a PC or Laptop, Bash or Terminal or any CLI, 
node, express, MySQL, and MYSQL2 installed.
